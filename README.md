# Griffin 

The Griffin is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagleâ€™s talons as its front feet. As the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle was the king of the birds, the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature.
